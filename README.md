## Software Architecture

#### Important Qualities

- Software Reuse: Users can create new sections to take notes and store information. Each newly created section functions simarly to each other, reusing the same code.
- Product Lifetime: The app is expected to be used throughout a student's education career and an educator's teaching career. The app is also expected to have new users on a consistent basis, further increasing its lifetime.
- Software Compatibility: Features of the app include note taking, support for video and pdf, assignment submission, and possible Blackboard integration. As such, it is important for the app to be compatible with other software that supports these features.
- The organization of the web app into modules reduces its complexity and thus improves its usability. The users can also create their own version of the modules and extend the system beyond its standard interface. This add flexibility to the architecture of Conveniote.
- Any new changes and added functionality made by the user occurs only at the userâ€™s end and are not hard-wired into the app. In this case, other users of the app will not be affected by those changes.
